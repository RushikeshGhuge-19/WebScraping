Ford said they wanted the Ranger to be “uncompromised” in its PHEV version and it feels like that goal has been reached. The PHEV Rangers drive slightly better than the diesel versions, offer the same carrying and towing abilities we demand, and provide an excellent cabin experience. Prices range from £40-52K OTR excluding VAT, which is higher than most of the diesel models, but you get a lot of truck and tech for your money. Truth be told, we expected the PHEV to feel like a stepping stone as the company edges towards a fully-electric model, but it feels like a peak in the range you should definitely consider. If you were looking for something to run as a commercial and personal vehicle, and you don’t mind paying the BIK, this could be the one to go for.

Read into “thing” what you like, there. But, thankfully, in the Puma Gen-E, Ford has done an electric car that makes a lot of sense.

Yet, following a recent update, does Ford's most compact model still deserve to be at the top? Well, on the outside you’ll have to be eagle-eyed to even notice the changes, with the Puma gaining a tweaked grille and headlight cluster. However, inside the differences are more substantial. There's a new interior to match the <a href=\"https://www.autotrader.co.uk/cars/ford/puma-gen-e\">all-electric Puma Gen-E</a> featuring a larger infotainment screen and digital driver display, plus some additional assistance tech. While the Puma’s handling is still leagues ahead of its competition, the amount of standard equipment is not generous, and the interior falls behind rivals like the <a href=\"https://www.autotrader.co.uk/cars/renault/captur\">Renault Captur</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autotrader.co.uk/cars/peugeot/2008\">Peugeot 2008</a>.
